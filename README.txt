== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I migrate from WP Help plugin? =

Definitely. Just convert your documents into `Help Documents` post type. You can either use the [Post Type Switcher](https://www.eventfeed.click/docs/ticket-checkout/) plugin or run this SQL query in your database:
`UPDATE wp_posts SET post_type = 'help-docs' WHERE post_type = 'wp-help'`

If you are using the Post Type Switcher, change the post type of your posts to `Help Documents`.
